            <div class="blood_give_data">
                Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:
                <h3>Age:</h3>
                <p>
                    You are aged between 18 and 65.
                </p>
                <h3>Weight:</h3>
                <p>
                    You weigh at least 50 kg. 
                </p>
                <h3>Health:</h3>
                <p>
                    You must be in good health at the time you donate.

                    You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.

                    If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.

                    If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.

                    You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation
                </p>
                <h3>Travel: </h3>
                <p>
                    Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral .

                    Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.
                </p>
                <h3>Behaviours:</h3>
                <p>
                    You must not give blood:

                    If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months

                    Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently: 

                    Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)

                    Have ever injected recreational drugs.
